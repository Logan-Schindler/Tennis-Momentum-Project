The final project for the Math Model Building class was to research the effects 
that momentum had in a tennis match. This paper first defines momentum within 
the context of tennis, then exploresways to use neural networks to predict the 
win probability of players and the flow of play in a tennis match. Using the 
2023 Wimbledon Gentlemen’s pointby-point data, we trained these neural 
networks and created a definition of momentum in the context of tennis to measure the phenomenon.
Using our definition of momentum, we analyze its accuracy on the 2023 Wimbledon Gentelmen’s Final match,
and conclude that momentum is not random, can be quantified, and can
positively indicate player performance during a match
